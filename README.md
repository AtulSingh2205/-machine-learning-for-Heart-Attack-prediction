# Image Processing and Feature Extraction Guide
Welcome to our image processing project! This guide will show you how to clean up images, find important features in them, and make those features easier to work with. Here’s what we’ll do:

1.Clean Up Images: We’ll use a method called Non-Local Means (NLM) to reduce noise in the images.
2.Find Features: We’ll use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify key features in the cleaned images.
3.Simplify Data: We’ll use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to make the feature data simpler to handle.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Clean Up Images
First, we’ll remove noise from our images using Non-Local Means (NLM). This helps to clear up the images while keeping important details like edges. If the images are in color, we’ll change them to black and white before cleaning.

2. Find Features with a CNN
Once the images are cleaned, we need to find key features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A CNN is a type of model that can recognize patterns in images. We’ll use a pre-trained CNN to get these features from our cleaned images.

3. Simplify the Data with PCA
The features from the CNN might be too detailed, so we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify them. PCA helps reduce the amount of information while keeping the most important parts. This makes the data easier to work with and analyze.
